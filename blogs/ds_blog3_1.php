							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

							<p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task.</p>

							<p><b>The goal of machine learning </b> is to develop algorithms and models that can identify patterns and relationships in data and make accurate predictions or decisions based on that data. This involves using statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze data, identify patterns and relationships, and develop models that can be used to make predictions or decisions.</p>

							<p>There are several different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means that the inputs and outputs are provided to the algorithm during the training process. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and it is up to the algorithm to identify patterns and relationships in the data. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm is trained through trial-and-error interactions with an environment.</p>

							<p>Machine learning has numerous applications in fields such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and social media, among others. Some popular examples of machine learning applications include fraud detection, image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.</p>
